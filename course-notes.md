## Perfection

- The design is not going to be good in the beginning, but it is definitely going to get better by time
- By producing more and more stuff you learn

## Designer vs. Developer

- The course is going to be focused for developers that want to learn about design

## Introduction to Layouts & Grids

- It is not a new thing to use grids for design
- Using grids brings order to chaos
- It is much easier to find places that have their own place in a system

## Balance: Symmetry

- Having symmetry creates a rhythm in looking at the piece

## Balance: Asymmetry

- Breaking the symmetry in the website design can be used to call to action
- First meaking the symmetry, and then breaking it works really well

## Exploring Asymmetry: Learning from art

- There are trianlges that make the watcher to go back and forth on the picture

## Shape

- Circles draw your eye
- They eye is constantly scanning for things, and often stops at things that move, circles, bright things etc.
- The circle lives outside of lines
  - For some reason the edge of the circle is has to have a margin of -5 to loog aligned
- Diagonals are dynamic
  - We will learn to use this in website design

## Shape and Cropping

- Composition
- Blowing up pictures and scaling them creates something new about the picture

## Grid

- Making and breaking the Grid
  - De facto standard book
- Even if the grid might look broken, there is the underlying grid and the baseline in the desings
- People are anchoring all the time
- These things matter
- "Architecture of space/layout"
  - Makes the design self-explanatory and easy to find around in
- Designing in the browser is not good
  - Because when you are developing you are in problem solving mode, and then you want to solve the thing as quickly and efficiently as possible
  - However, when doing design you should put your "designer hat" on ans think about the problem in a different way

## Tools

- Photoshop
- Illustrator
- Sketch

## Photoshop quickeys

## Layout and composition time

- Creating initial layouts will help in starting a conversation when deciding the layout
- Doing this before anything else will create a good basis to build upon

## Primitive Shape Excercise

## Layout in CSS

## Using ClipPath  & Other Masking Tools

- css property clippath allows to create e.g. polygons

## CSS writing mode

## Grid by Example Demo

- By using gridbyexample.com you can find good starters for layouts 
  - Eg. Grid by Example 12 is the example used in the workshop

## Color modes

## Color mixing

- Additive and subtractive mixing
- CMYK subtractive
  - subracting light
  - for printing
- RGB additive
  - for the screen
- Color wheel
  - monochromatic
  - complementary
  - analogous
  - tradic
- "A color is only a color in relation to another color"
- https://colorable.jxnblk.com/
  - enter two colors and tells how good the contrast is

## Types of color combinations

- https://color.adobe.com/create
  - It has many ready made palettes that you can use
- https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/02/color-theory-for-designer-part-3-creating-your-own-color-palettes/

### Monochromatic

- By just sticking to one colour you can get quite good looking color palettes

###  Analogous

- Colors that are next to each other on the color spectrum

### Split

### Triad

- Can look really good but is easy to mess up

### Complementary

- Even if you would select an analogous palette, you are going to need a complementary color to draw the users attention to specific things

### Tetriadic 

### Compound

- Whatever you want it to be

### Monotone 

### Duotone

- Spotify ads use duotone
- Taking to tones and matching them up to each others

### Colors and shadows

- If you shine a yellow light onto a box, the shadow will be purple

### Contrast

- Things that are far away are going to be blurrier and have lower contrast
- Things that are near are sharp and have high contrast

### RGB(A)

- RGB is not a good way to define colors in the browser
- It doesn't easily allow to make a color e.g. brighter 

### HSL(A)

- Is human readable and a good way to define colors in the browser
- Hue, saturation, and lightness
- There is a new color format coming that is the "CSS Grid" of color formats
- Named colors are good for demos, but for nothing more

### Color variables

- Keeps things consistent
- Helps in large applications when you have to make changes
- Sass/scss enables to use functions as lighten, darken, saturate

### Limited color

- Composition idea => add more colors step by step
- Enables to create the color palette the same way that the composition of the UI was created

### Paletton 

- https://paletton.com

### Gradients

- https://cssgradient.io/
- Don't animate gradients, as they are heavy to calculate and therefore slows the site down
- https://codepen.io/sdras/pen/akAWPR

### How to create a color palette

- Find the more serious and energetic variants of the color, but also the corporate and serious variant of the colors 
- Find the accents that work with the primary color

### Example of using HSL and colors

## Typography

- People are into typography
- There are many conferences only about typography
- https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/why-typography-matters-especially-at-the-oscars-f7b00e202f22/
- Serif
- Sans serif
- Script Font
- Handwritten
- Display Font
- Novelty Font
- Slab serif is also a possibility

### Typography Resources

- Google Fonts
- Font Squirrel
  - Has a webfont generator
- Fonts.com
  - a tool called whatthefont
- myfonts.com
  - tool called whatthefont that analyzes a screencapture and tells what the font is https://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/
- Hoefler&Co.
  - Very expensive
  - Like going to look at a puppy

### Pairing fonts

- You should use multiple fonts for a site
- Don't use anymore than 3 fonts
- Don't pick fonts that are too similiar to each other
- Changing the letter spacing and stuff allows to modify the font in different ways
- Google Fonts has the pairing mode
- The body text should be a bit "boring"
- The 2 fonts shouldn't be too similiar
- https://fontjoy.com

## Typography for Lawyers

- Line length should be 45-90 characters so that the text is easier to read

## Typographic Color

- If you are creating a large block of body text, make sure that when you squint your eyes, it should look even and it shouldn't have these chunks of parts of text
- Fluid typography
  - Used in CSS tricks so that when you scale down to a smaller screen, the text gets also smaller

## Terminology

- Monospaced vs proportional
- Kerning & Leading
- Kerning is the space between the letters from side to side (letter spacing)
- Leading (line-height and vertical-align: baseline)
- Widows and Orphans
  - Words that are left alone on one line 
- Ligatures
- "Falling down"
  - A book has more room under the text than what they have at the top
- Font performance
  - Fonts are heavy and optimizing them might save a lot of loading time
- Peter Mueller and subfont

# Inspiration

## Remixing

- Stealing is not okay, however, each piece of design is often a combination of previous designs that together creates something new
- Look around, find your heroes 
- Get inspered from multiple sources, but don't copy them directly. Instead wait and work from memory the next day
- Reverse engineering
